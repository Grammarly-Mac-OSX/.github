## What is Grammarly?

Grammarly is an advanced AI-powered writing assistant that helps improve clarity, correctness, tone, and overall readability across documents, emails, browsers, and desktop applications. It uses real-time language analysis to identify grammar mistakes, spelling errors, punctuation issues, stylistic inconsistencies, and unclear sentences while offering precise suggestions and rewrites.

Unlike traditional spell checkers, Grammarly understands context, intent, and tone. It analyzes entire sentences, detects structural issues, and provides helpful alternatives that improve writing flow. The tool is widely used by professionals, students, teams, and businesses to ensure polished and effective communication.

On desktop, Grammarly offers a unified workspace for writing, editing, and reviewing text. The standalone editor provides formatting tools, document statistics, version history, and real-time scoring for clarity, engagement, delivery, and correctness. Integration with Word, Outlook, Chrome, Safari, and other apps allows Grammarly to check writing everywhere you type.

Grammarly adapts to your writing style, offering custom dictionaries, personal preferences, tone goals, and brand guidelines (for teams). The system learns from user interactions and continuously improves recommendations based on the context of your writing.

Whether you are composing a document, drafting an email, preparing a business proposal, writing academic content, or posting online, Grammarly enhances your writing with accuracy and professional quality.
